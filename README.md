# Project Setup
This project requires references to kCura's RelativityÂ® SDK dlls.  These dlls are not part of the open source project and must be obtained through kCura.  In the "packages" folder under "Source" you will need to create a "Relativity" folder if one does not exist.  You will need to add the following dlls:
- kCura.Agent.dll
- kCura.EventHandler.dll
- kCura.Relativity.Client.dll
- Relativity.API.dll
- Relativity.CustomPages.dll
